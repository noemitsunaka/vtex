## How is the traffic source of the orders different on VTEX and on Google Analytics?

Last Interaction model in Google Analytics assigns the credit to the final interaction that immediately precede conversions.

Example: A customer finds your e-commerce by clicking on a Facebook ad. Later, she returns by an Instagram stories and leave again. Next day, one of your remarketing campaigns is responsible for her going back, but she exit after open up the link. After two hours, she directly digit your website URL and makes a purchase.

On Google Analytics, the attribution will be to Direct channel because the last touchpoint before conversion was herself directly going to the website and buying something.

VTEX cookies' expire earlier than Google Analytics, that's why sometimes the traffic sources won't match.
